# Formant-analysis-of-Dysarthria-speakers
Utilizing speech samples from the Nemours Database of Dysarthric Speech, we selected three participants with differing tongue movement scores. Acoustic analysis was conducted on three vowels (/i/, /u/, /a/) by extracting the first two formant frequencies (F1, F2) using Praat scripting, originally based on Mietta Lennes's script.
